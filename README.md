# reflecticon-224

An emulation of the Lexicon 224, 224X and 224XL digital reverbs that runs
the machines' own firmware, in your browser or as a plugin. You supply the
ROMs.

[Biography of the machine's designer](https://www.davidgriesinger.com/biographies/) (with photo of him prototyping on the bench!).

I'm still not sure what's more impressive: designing the reverb algorithms (initially without realtime rendering hardware) or
designing and building the machine that runs the algorithms. 1975-1978 predates DSP chips by a few years, so David Griesinger built a
programmable DSP out of a few boards of 7400 series TTL logic chips. An 8080 host computer writes ~100 32-bit instructions to a shared
Writable Control Store, and these run in a straight line once per audio frame. Throughput is one Delay Memory access and one MAC per microinstruction.
